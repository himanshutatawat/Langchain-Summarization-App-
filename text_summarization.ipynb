    "The Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra has completed two months. The ‘Vikas Rath’ (Development Chariot) that is moving in this yatra is the ‘Vishwas Rath’ (Confidence Chariot), and now people are also calling it the ‘Guarantee Wala Rath’ (Guarantee Chariot). There is belief that no one will be left behind and no one will miss the benefits of any schemes. Therefore, in the villages where Modi’s guaranteed vehicle has not yet reached, people are now eagerly waiting for it. Initially, we had planned this yatra until January 26, but with so much support and increased demand, people from every village are saying that Modi’s guaranteed vehicle should come to their place. Since I came to know about this, I have told our government officials to extend it a bit beyond January 26. People need it and there is a demand, therefore, we have to fulfil it. Therefore, maybe after a few days, it will be decided that Modi’s guaranteed vehicle will continue in the month of February as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Friends,\n",
    "\n",
    "When we started this yatra on November 15 with the blessings of Bhagwan Birsa Munda, we did not imagine its success to be so great. In the past few days, I have had the opportunity to connect with this yatra several times. I have had conversations with many beneficiaries. In just two months, the Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra has transformed into a people’s movement. Wherever Modi’s guaranteed vehicle is reaching, people are welcoming it with great enthusiasm. So far, 15 crore people have joined the Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra. And our Health Minister Mansukh Bhai has shared many statistics with you. This yatra has reached approximately 70-80 percent of the country’s panchayats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Friends,\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of the Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra was to reach those people who, for some reason, have been deprived of government schemes until now. And Modi respects and inquires about such individuals who have not been taken care of. If one were to study, they would find that the Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra is the best medium for last mile delivery campaigns. Health check-ups were conducted for more than 4 crore people during this yatra. Over 2 crore people were screened for tuberculosis during this yatra. In tribal areas, screening for sickle cell anemia was done for more than 50 lakh people.\n",
    "\n",
    "The saturation approach in the Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra has brought the government to the doorsteps of so many marginalized individuals. More than 50 lakh Ayushman cards have been distributed during this yatra. More than 50 lakh people applied for insurance schemes. Over 33 lakh new beneficiaries were added to the PM Kisan Yojana. More than 25 lakh new beneficiaries were added to the Kisan Credit Card scheme. Over 22 lakh new beneficiaries applied for free gas connections. More than 10 lakh people applied for the PM SVANidhi scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "And friends,\n",
    "\n",
    "These numbers may be just figures for some, but for me, each number represents a life, a fellow Indian brother or sister, a family member who was excluded from the benefits of government schemes until now. Therefore, our effort is to move towards saturation in every sector. Our effort is to ensure that everyone gets the guarantee of nutrition, health, and treatment. Our effort is to provide every family with a pucca house and every house with the facility of gas connection, water, electricity, and toilets. Our effort is to expand the scope of cleanliness. Every street, every neighbourhood and every family should be included in it. Our effort is to ensure that everyone has a bank account and an opportunity of self-employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Friends,\n",
    "\n",
    "When work is done with good intentions, and efforts are made honestly, the results also follow. The recent report on the reduction of poverty in Bharat is very encouraging. Not only in Bharat, but the world is also looking at Bharat’s perspective, the model of governance, and the path developing countries can take to overcome poverty. The fresh report (which came just a few days ago) suggests that nearly 25 crore people have come out of poverty in the last 9 years of our government. The reduction of poverty in Bharat was once considered unimaginable, but the poor of Bharat have proved that if they are given resources, they can overcome poverty.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past 10 years, the way our government has established a transparent system, made genuine efforts, and increased public participation, it has made the impossible possible. One can understand how the government is working for the poor through the PM Awas Yojana as well. In the last 10 years, more than 4 crore poor families have been provided with their own pucca houses. The success of providing pucca houses to more than 4 crore poor families is a significant achievement and the poor are pouring in blessings. What’s interesting is that registrations for more than 70 percent of these houses have been in the names of women, making our sisters the owners. This scheme has not only helped lift people out of poverty but has also assisted in empowering women.\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of houses in rural areas has also been increased. Earlier, the government used to intervene in how houses should be built, but now people are constructing homes according to their preferences. The construction of houses under housing schemes has been expedited by the government. In the previous administrations where it took more than 300 days for houses to be built, the average construction time for PM Awas houses is around 100 days. This means we are building pucca houses three times faster than before and providing them to the poor. This speed is not just the speed of work; it’s the speed of our hearts, the love for the poor in our hearts that propels us, making the work happen quickly. Such efforts have played a significant role in reducing poverty in the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "Friends,\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of how our government is giving priority to the uplift of marginalized communities is the transgender community, often referred to as the ‘Kinnar’ community. Just now, I was in detailed conversation with a representative of the transgender community, and you might have heard about it. Nobody bothered about the transgender community for decades after independence. It is our government that has, for the first time, addressed the difficulties faced by the transgender community, prioritizing making their lives easier. In 2019, the government enacted a law to protect the rights of the transgender community. This not only provided the transgender community a respectable position in society but also helped eliminate discrimination against them. The government has issued transgender identity certificates to thousands of people, as mentioned by the transgender community representative, who stated that everyone now has an ID-card. The government has plans for them, and the transgender community is also helping us. As revealed in a conversation just now, members of the transgender community are continuously benefiting from various schemes for the welfare of the poor.\n",
    "\n",
    "My dear family members,\n",
    "\n",
    "Bharat is changing, and it is changing rapidly. Today, people’s self-confidence, their trust in the government, and the commitment to building a new Bharat are visible everywhere. Just two days ago, I was talking to people from the extremely backward tribal community in the PM JANMAN campaign. I interacted with people from the tribal community. I observed how the women of tribal villages are collaboratively planning the development of their villages. These are women from villages where, despite decades of independence, the benefits of development schemes did not reach them. However, these women are well informed and actively engaged in ensuring that the benefits of government schemes reach their families and communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In today’s program also, we witnessed how joining self-help groups has brought unprecedented changes to the lives of our sisters. Before 2014, forming self-help groups in the country was merely a bureaucratic program confined to paperwork, often organized for the sake of political programs. The economic strength and expansion of the work of self-help groups were not initially prioritized.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is our government that has connected self-help groups with banks on a larger scale. We also increased the loan limit without collateral from 10 lakhs to 20 lakhs. In the past 10 years of our government, nearly 10 crore sisters have joined self-help groups. They have received assistance from banks for self-employment exceeding 8 lakh crores. This is not a small figure, and it reflects our commitment to empower these poor mothers. I have full confidence in these mothers and sisters. I believe that if they are given opportunities, they will not lag behind. Thousands of sisters have started new enterprises, and 3 crore women have become empowered as women farmers. Lakhs of sisters across the country have become prosperous and self-reliant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further accelerating this initiative, the government has initiated the task of creating 2 crore “Lakhpati Didi” in three years. To provide new means of employment for women associated with self-help groups, Namo Drone Didi has been launched. While discussions about Chandrayaan (lunar mission) are essential, envision the sight when the sisters from my self-help group would operate drones, assisting in agricultural work in villages. Under this initiative, 15,000 drones will be made available to Namo Drone Didis. Training programs have been started for them, and I am pleased to announce that training for more than a thousand Namo Drone Didis has already been completed. Due to Namo Drone Didis, the income of self-help groups will increase, their self-reliance will grow, the village sisters will gain new self-confidence, and, importantly, it will be beneficial for our farmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "My family members,\n",
    "\n",
    "The top priority of our government is to modernize the rural economy and empower farmers. Therefore, the government strives to enhance the strength of small farmers, reduce their agricultural expenses, and ensure they receive better prices in the market. Keeping this in mind, the government launched a campaign to create 10,000 new Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) in the country. Today, nearly 8,000 FPOs have already been established.\n",
    "\n",
    "The government is making efforts for the protection and security of livestock as well. We have heard about people getting the COVID vaccine, saving lives; the praise for it, that Modi administered the vaccine for free, life saved… the family saved. But beyond this, what is Modi’s vision, what does he do? Our farmers and those involved in animal husbandry suffer losses of thousands of crores of rupees every year due to diseases like Foot and Mouth Disease among animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also affects milk production. To address this challenge, a massive campaign has been launched for the first time after independence. Under this initiative, more than 50 crore animals have been vaccinated so far. The government has spent more than 15,000 crores on this campaign. The result of this campaign is that milk production in the country has increased by more than 50 percent. This has benefited livestock keepers and farmers, and the country as a whole.\n",

    "Today, Bharat is one of the youngest countries in the world. Continuous efforts are being made in the country to enhance the potential of the youth, and the Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra is also contributing to this. Numerous quiz competitions have been conducted during this period. Additionally, talented players from every corner of the country are also being honoured. I am pleased to note that a large number of our youth are registering as ‘My Bharat Volunteer’ in the Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra. Crores of people have pledged to make Bharat a developed nation during this yatra. The energy to build a developed nation is derived from these resolutions. We are all committed to completing the journey towards a ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047. I believe that you will also join this campaign. Once again, I express my gratitude to those with whom I had the opportunity to converse, and for welcoming and honouring Modi’s guaranteed vehicle in such large numbers, thank you all very much.\n",

       "\"नमस्ते,\\n\\nविक्सित भारत संकल्प यात्रा के दो महीने पूरे हो चुके हैं। 'विकस रथ' (विकास रथ) अब 'विश्वास रथ' (विश्वास रथ) और 'गारंटी वाला रथ' (गारंटी वाला रथ) के नाम से प्रसिद्ध है। लोगों को विश्वास है कि कोई भी व्यक्ति पीछे रह जाएगा और कोई भी योजना के लाभ से वंचित नहीं रहेगा। इसलिए, मोदी के गारंटी वाहन के मार्ग पर नहीं पहुंचे हुए गांवों में लोग अब इंतजार कर रहे हैं। पहले इसकी योजना जनवरी 26 तक थी, लेकिन लोगों के समर्थन और Increased मांग के कारण, लोगों ने कहा कि मोदी के गारंटी वाहन उनके गांव में आना चाहिए। जब मैंने इसके बारे में जाना तो मैंने अपने सरकारी अधिकारियों को जनवरी 26 से थोड़ा आगे延伸 करने के लिए कहा। लोगों की जरूरत है और मांग है, इसलिए हमें इसका पूरा कराना होगा।sequently, maybe some days later, it will be decided that मोदी के गारंटी वाहन का संचालन फरवरी में भी किया जाएगा।\\n\\nदोस्तों, जब हमने यह यात्रा 15 नवंबर को शुरू की थी, तो हमने इसके सफल होने का सोचा नहीं था। पिछले कुछ दिनों में मैंने इस यात्रा से कई बार संपर्क किया है। मैंने कई लाभार्थियों से बातचीत की है। दो महीने में ही, विक्सित भारत संकल्प यात्रा ने लोगों की रैली में बदल दिया है। जहां मोदी के गारंटी वाहन पहुंचा है, वहां लोग उसे बहुत उत्साह से स्वीकार कर रहे हैं। अब तक, 15 करोड़ लोगों ने विक्सित भारत संकल्प यात्रा का हिस्सा बना लिया है।\\n\\nदोस्तों, विक्सित भारत संकल्प यात्रा का मुख्य उद्देश्य उन लोगों तक पहुंचाना था जिन्हें सरकारी योजनाओं से वंचित किया गया था। और मोदी ऐसे व्यक्तियों के लिए सम्मान और संबोधन करता है। यदि कोई अध्ययन करे, तो वह पाएंगा कि विक्सित भारत संकल्प यात्रा लास्ट माइल डिलीवरी कैंपेन का सबसे अच्छा माध्यम है। इस यात्रा के दौरान स्वास्थ्य जांचें 4 करोड़ से अधिक लोगों की गई है। इस यात्रा के दौरान टीबी के स्क्रीनिंग 2 करोड़ से अधिक लोगों की गई है। जनजाति क्षेत्रों में सिकल सेल एनीमिया के स्क्रीनिंग ५० लाख से अधिक लोगों की गई है।\\n\\nयात्रा के समग्र समाधान ने सरकार को ऐसे कई सीमांत व्यक्तियों के दरवाजे तक ले गया है। इस यात्रा के दौरान ५० लाख आयुष्मान कार्ड बांटे गए हैं। ५० लाख लोगों ने बीमा योजनाओं के लिए आवेदन किया है। ३३ लाख नए लाभार्थी पीएम किसान योजना में शामिल हुए हैं। २५ लाख नए लाभार्थी किसान क्रेडिट कार्ड योजना में शामिल हुए हैं। २२ लाख नए लाभार्थी मुफ्त गैस कनेक्शन योजना में शामिल हुए हैं। १० लाख लोग पीएम एसवानिधि योजना के लिए आवेदन किया है।\\n\\nदोस्तों, इन संख्याओं के लिए कुछ लोगों के लिए बस संख्याएं हैं, लेकिन मेरे लिए हर संख्या एक जीवन, एक भारतीय भाई-बहन, एक परिवार का सदस्य है, जिसे सरकारी योजनाओं के लाभ से वंचित किया गया था। इसलिए, हमारा प्रयास है कि हर क्षेत्र में संतोष की स्थिति में पहुंच जाए। हमारा प्रयास है कि हर परिवार को पुख्ता घर मिले और हर घर को गैस कनेक्शन, पानी, बिजली और टॉयलेट की सुविधा मिले। हमारा प्रयास है कि स्वच्छता के क्षेत्र में विस्तार हो। हर सड़क, हर नेवरहुड और हर परिवार में इसका शामिल होना चाहिए। हमारा प्रयास है कि हर व्यक्ति को बैंक अकाउंट मिले और स्व-रोजगार की संभावना मिले।\\n\\nदोस्तों, जब काम अच्छे इरादे से किया जाता है और ईमानदार प्रयास किए जाते हैं, तो नतीजे भी मिलते हैं। हाल ही में भारत की गरीबी की रिपोर्ट बहुत उज्जवल है। नहीं केवल भारत, बल्कि दुनिया भारत की दिशा, सरकार के मॉडल और गरीबी से निपटने के लिए देशों की ओर देख रही है। हाल ही में आई रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, भारत में ९ साल में करीब २५ करोड़ लोग गरीबी से निकल आए हैं। गरीबी की कमी को भारत में एक असंभव माना जाता था, लेकिन भारत के गरीबों ने साबित कर दिया है कि यदि उन्हें संसाधन मिले तो वे गरीबी से निकल सकते हैं।\\n\\nपिछले १० साल में हमारी सरकार ने स-transparent सिस्टम स्थापित किया है, ईमानदार प्रयास किए हैं और लोगों की भागीदारी को बढ़ाया है, इसलिए हमें गरीबों के लिए काम करना संभव हुआ है। एक तरफ पीएम आवास योजना के माध्यम से भी देखा जा सकता है। पिछले १० साल में करीब ४ करोड़ गरीब परिवारों को अपना पुख्ता घर मिला है। पुख्ता घरों की सफलता का एक महत्वपूर्ण उपलब्धि है और गरीबों ने इसके लिए बLESSING प्राप्त है। intéressant है कि इन घरों के लिए करीब ७० प्रतिशत नामों में Frauen नाम हैं, जिससे हमारी सISTER्स ने मालिक है। यह योजना न केवल गरीबी से निकलने में मदद करती है, बल्कि महिलाओं को सशक्त भी करती है।\\n\\nग्रामीण क्षेत्रों में घरों का आकार भी बढ़ाया गया है। पिछले सरकारों ने घरों के निर्माण में हस्तक्षेप किया था, लेकिन अब लोग अपने पसंदीदा घर बना रहे हैं। घरों के निर्माण की गति सरकार ने तेज कर दी है। पिछले प्रशासनों में घरों का निर्माण ३०० दिनों में होता था, लेकिन पीएम आवास घरों का निर्माण औसतन १०० दिनों में होता है। इसका मतलब है कि हम तीन गुना तेजी से घर बना रहे हैं और गरीबों को दे रहे हैं। इस तेजी में काम की नहीं, बल्कि हमारे दिलों में गरीबों के लिए प्रेम है, जिससे काम हो रहा है।\\n\\nदोस्तों, हमारे सरकार की प्राथमिकता है कि ग्रामीण अर्थव्यवस्था को आधुनिक बनाया जाए और किसानों की मदद की जाए। इसलिए, सरकार की कोशिश है कि छोटे किसानों की ताकत को बढ़ाया जाए, उनके कृषि लागत को घटाया जाए और उन्हें बेहतर मूल्य में मिले। इस उद्देश्य से सरकार ने किसान प्रोड्यूसर ऑर्गनाइजेशंस (FPOs) की स्थापना की है। आज, करीब ८,००० FPOs स्थापित हो चुके हैं।\\n\\nसरकार कोशिश है कि पशु चिकित्सा क्षेत्र में सुरक्षा और सुरक्षा की सुविधा मिले। हमने लोगों के लिए कोविड वैक्सीन देने की बात सुनी है, जीवन बचाने की प्रशंसा कर रहे हैं, मोदी को यह वैक्सीन मुफ्त दी है, जीवन बचाने का काम... परिवार बचाने का काम... लेकिन मोदी की दृष्टि क्या है, क्या करता है? हमारे किसान और पशु चिकित्सा से जुड़े लोग हर साल Thousands of करोड़ रुपये की हानि से पीड़ित होते हैं क्योंकि पशु चिकित्सा से जुड़े रोगों जैसे फुट और माउथ डिजीज।\\n\\nइस चुनौती को संबोधित करने के लिए सबसे पहले स्वतंत्रता के बाद सरकार ने एक बड़ा अभियान शुरू किया है। इस अभियान के दौरान अब तक ५० करोड़ पशुओं की वैक्सीन लगाई गई है। सरकार ने इस अभियान पर १५,००० करोड़ रुपये खर्च किए हैं। इस अभियान के परिणाम से देश की दूध उत्पादन में ५० प्रतिशत की वृद्धि हुई है। इसने पशुओं के स्वामी और किसानों के लिए लाभ प्रदान किया है और देश के लिए भी लाभ प्रदान किया है।\\n\\nदोस्तों, आज भारत एक युवा देश है। लगातार कोशिश है कि देश के युवाओं की क्षमता को बढ़ाया जाए और विक्सित भारत संकल्प यात्रा भी इसका हिस्सा है। इस यात्रा के दौरान कई क्वीज कॉम्पिटिशन्स हुए हैं। इसके अलावा, देश के हर कोने से मेहनातक खिलाड़ियों को सम्मानित किया गया है। मैं प्रसन्न हूँ कि हमारे युवा हजारों लोगों ने 'मेरा भारत वोल्यून्टर' के रूप में पंजीकरण किया है। करोड़ों लोगों ने भारत को विकसित राष्ट्र बनाने की शपथ ली है। विकसित भारत का निर्माण एक एनर्जी है, जिसका स्रोत है इन शपथों से। हम सभी कॉम्पलीट होकर विक्सित भारत का निर्माण करने का संकल्प ले हैं। मैं आपको भी इसका हिस्सा बनने की प्रार्थना करता हूँ। एक बार फिर, मैं उन लोगों के लिए धन्यवाद प्राप्त करता हूँ जिनसे मैंने बातचीत की है और मोदी के गारंटी वाहन को इतने बड़े संख्या में स्वीकार किया है, आपका धन्यवाद है।\""

The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area.

Our country is blessed with natural resources, has shown c onsiderable \\nprogress in the last sixty years, and above all we have hard wor king people particularly \\nthe power of the 540 million youth of the country. Every sector of our count ry has given \\nme the \\nconfidence that India can become a developed nation well before 2020. Whomsoever, I \\nmet they constantly ask what they can give to the nation. We should c onstantly strive to \\nempower such members of the society. With this spirit, I am extr emely happy that we are \\non the right path. Here I am reminded of a famous poem: \\n\"When you wish upon a star, \\nMakes no difference who you are, \\nAnything your heart desires, \\nWill come to you” \\nThis poem is true to all of us, and particularly for our youth and if they aim great, I am \\nsure they will reach close to the target or the target. \\n \\nMy dear citizens, let us resolve to continue to work for realizing the missions of \\ndeveloped India 2020 with the following distinctive profile. \\n \\n1. A Nation where the rural and urban divide has reduced to a thin line. \\n \\n2. A Nation where there is an equitable distribution and adequate access to energy and \\nquality water. \\n \\n3. A Nation where agriculture, industry and service sector work together in symphony. \\n \\n4. A Nation where education with value system is not denied to any meritorious \\ncandidates because of societal or economic discrimination. \\n \\n5. A Nation which is the best destination for the most talented scholars, scientists, and \\ninvestors. \\n \\n6. A Nation where the best of health care is available to all. \\n \\n7. A Nation where the governance is responsive, transparent and corruption free. \\n \\n8. A Nation where poverty has been totally eradicated, illiteracy removed and crimes \\nagainst women and children are absent and none in the society feels alienated. \\n \\n9. A Nation that is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful and happy and continues with a \\nsustainable growth path.'),\n",

However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity.

      "Speech:The speech, delivered by A.P.J. Abdul Kalam on his last day as the President of India, is a departing message to the country and its people. He expresses his gratitude to everyone he has interacted with during his five-year tenure, representing various walks of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights 10 key messages that he wants to convey to the nation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerate development by listening to the aspirations of the youth\n",
      "2. Empower villages and mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness\n",
      "3. Focus on agricultural growth through the \"Seed to Food\" initiative\n",
      "4. Overcome problems through partnership and collaboration\n",
      "5. Display courage in combating calamities and challenges\n",
      "6. Ensure connectivity for societal transformation\n",
      "7. Defend the nation and its pride\n",
      "8. Encourage a youth movement to achieve a Developed India by 2020\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also shares a personal anecdote about a young girl named Anukriti, who asked him why India couldn't become a developed nation by 2020. The President's response was to appreciate her question and assure her that it was a thoughtful inquiry, and he would work towards making India a developed nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question, called it thoughtful, and assured the person that their dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and worked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the aspirations of Indian youth to live in a developed and prosperous India. The speaker, likely the President of India, emphasizes the importance of empowering villages and mobilizing their core competence for competitiveness. The speech mentions a specific initiative, Periyar PURA, which aims to provide urban amenities in rural areas by connecting 65 villages with physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity. This has resulted in employment generation, creation of entrepreneurs, and overall development of the villages. The speech also touches on the need for physical connectivity in rural areas, using the example of Nagaland, where quality roads are necessary for faster movement of products from villages to markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the success of the Periyar Panchayat Union Rural Area (PURA) project in Thanjavur district, which has generated employment and created entrepreneurs through the support of 1000 self-help groups. The project has developed 200 acres of wasteland into cultivable land, where villagers are now engaged in various activities such as farming, power generation using biomass, food processing, and marketing. The project has also enabled the villagers to develop internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products with the support of Japanese experts. The speaker emphasizes the importance of PURA projects in bridging the rural-urban divide and suggests that the whole country needs around 7000 such projects to achieve this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is sharing two enriching experiences:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Meeting over 6,000 farmers from various states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they showed interest in the various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasized the importance of doubling agricultural production with reduced resources and improving the economic conditions of the nation through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. He expressed confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through the partnership of farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "2. Meeting a wheelchair-bound individual, Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who had no hands or legs. Despite his physical limitations, he had a radiant smile and expressed gratitude to God, his parents, and teachers for giving him confidence and training. When asked what he needed from the speaker, he replied that he just wanted to sing in front of him. This experience taught the speaker the importance of not focusing on material needs, but rather on the joy and confidence that people can have despite their circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights two inspiring stories:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The speaker shares an encounter with a person who has a physical disability, but is extremely talented in music. Despite his limitations, he was encouraged by his parents, teachers, and others to pursue his passion, and even performed in a prestigious event at the Rashtrapati Bhavan art theatre.\n",
      "2. The speaker recounts a visit to a village in Jammu & Kashmir that was affected by a devastating earthquake in 2005. Despite the severe damage and losses, the villagers showed remarkable resilience and courage in rebuilding their lives. They had praise for the rescue and relief efforts by the Army, Air Force, and state government, and had become the \"masters of their problems\" rather than letting them define them. The speaker emphasizes the importance of partnership and community support in overcoming the impact of disasters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is reflecting on their experiences during natural disasters and calamities. In the recent relief operation, they saw children and villagers bravely participating alongside the Armed Forces, with the children even smiling and interacting with the speaker. The speaker also witnessed the Chief Justice and State Government authorities settling relief grants on the spot for victims of the earthquake.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker then recalls a visit to Car Nicobar Islands in 2005, where they met with Tribal Council Leaders and children who had been affected by the 2004 Tsunami. Despite the loss of life and property, the islanders had taken in affected victims as their own, with no concept of orphanages. The speaker was moved by their courage and wrote a poem called \"Sea Waves\" which was sung by the villagers with enthusiasm and courage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the speaker mentions addressing the Pan African Parliament in Johannesburg, South Africa, where they emphasized the importance of connectivity for societal transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the \"Pan African e-Network\" project, a $100 million initiative to connect 53 African countries with a seamless network of satellite, fiber optics, and wireless connections. The project aims to connect 12 universities, 17 hospitals, and 53 tele-medicine and tele-education centers across Africa. A pilot project in Ethiopia has already been launched, with Indira Gandhi National Open University offering an MBA course to 34 Ethiopian students and CARE Hospital providing tele-medicine services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights several initiatives and achievements by the Indian government. The speaker mentions a tele-consultation service provided by Hyderabad to doctors in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, since 2006, which has enabled instant communication between African countries. The speaker also expresses pride in India's defense forces, mentioning specific experiences and missions carried out by the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force. The speaker also acknowledges the contributions of para-military forces, central and state police personnel, and internal security forces in ensuring the safety and security of citizens. Additionally, the speaker mentions a youth movement called Lead India 2020, which aims to transform Indian youth into enlightened citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing the importance of transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens. They highlight the work of the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh, particularly in Medak district. The training has reportedly led to positive changes in the students, including self-discipline, love for parents and teachers, and a sense of duty towards the nation. The speaker also shares a personal anecdote about a student leader who inspired her father to quit smoking after attending a training camp. The speaker emphasizes the importance of empowering India's 540 million youth under the age of 25 through value-based education and leadership, considering them the most powerful resource on earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural and civilizational heritage while pursuing economic growth. The speaker notes that the country has made significant progress in the last 60 years and has a strong foundation of natural resources, hardworking people, and a young population (540 million youth). They express confidence that India can become a developed nation before 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker highlights the need for countrywide participation and empowerment of individuals to achieve this goal. They propose a distinctive profile for a developed India 2020, which includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reducing the rural-urban divide\n",
      "2. Ensuring equitable access to energy and quality water\n",
      "3. Harmonious development of agriculture, industry, and services\n",
      "4. Providing education with value systems to all meritorious students, regardless of societal or economic background\n",
      "5. Becoming a top destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech concludes by encouraging citizens to work towards realizing these missions and quotes a famous poem, \"When You Wish Upon a Star\", to inspire the youth to aim high and reach their targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is outlining a vision for an ideal nation, where:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Everyone has access to the best healthcare\n",
      "* Governance is responsive, transparent, and corruption-free\n",
      "* Poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children are eradicated\n",
      "* No one feels alienated or left out\n",
      "* The nation is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy, with sustained growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam expresses gratitude to the citizens of India for their cooperation and support over the past five years. He reflects on his mission, which is to unite the hearts and minds of the Indian people and instill self-confidence, particularly the phrase \"we can do it\". He reaffirms his commitment to leading the country towards development by 2020 and ends with a blessing and a call to \"Jai Hind\" (Victory to India).\n",
